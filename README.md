This app is the outcome of a CIS*4910 Computer Science Thesis course at the University of Guelph.  The purpose is to automatically perform statistical inference on a binomial-response data-set, specifically in the realm of Seafood Mislabelling prediction, in which a binomial response is common. 

This app performs statistical computation on the following inference procedures:

- Data Wrangling

  
Dataset choice

ariable standardization

Omits missing values

Removes observations of small categories

Response, predictor variable selection


-	Summary Statistics of categorical variables

  
Success ratio

Odds, log odds ratio’s

Proportion standard errors

Proportion confidence intervals


-	Visuals


Mosaic plots

Sigmoid plots


-	Univariate models


Model p-value

Model AIC


-	Multivariate models


Performs Forward Variable Selection

Coefficient estimates

Standard errors

Z-value, p-value

AIC

Choice of significance level


-	Bayesian Inference


Choice of Priors and prior hyperparameters

Estimates

Credible intervals 

R-hat

Effective Sample Size

Trace plots


This app was developed by Fynn De Vuono-Fraser, inspired by research done by Fynn, Dr. Jarrett Phillips and Dr. Daniel Gillis.
